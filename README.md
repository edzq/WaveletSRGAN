# PyTorch-SRGAN
A modern PyTorch implementation of Wavelet-SRGAN

https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.10213

You can start training out-of-the-box with the CIFAR-10 or CIFAR-100 datasets, to emulate the paper results however, you will need to download and clean the ImageNet dataset yourself. Results and weights are provided for the ImageNet dataset. 


## Requirements

* PyTorch
* torchvision
* tensorboard_logger (https://github.com/TeamHG-Memex/tensorboard_logger)
* WaveletPacket2D
